# Introduction and Explanation

You'll add the mod. You'll enable the mod. By default, it won't do anything. That's okay.

It might only work on new games, because it adds a Map Component, and because I really don't know.

Within the game, it adds a MainTab, probably in the far-bottom-right-corner, labeled "UberMicro", with a button to turn the whole thing ON or OFF, and more buttons to turn specific features ON or OFF.

You'll leave the whole thing OFF most of the time. And it still won't do anything. And that's still okay.

But when the shit really, really hits the fan, and your colony is in serious trouble, there will be a few critical game-hours where you need absolutely everybody to do exactly as you say, continously, without a single wasted moment, or else everybody is going to die today.

And when this time is upon you, this is when you'll go into the MainTab and hit the button to turn it ON. This is why you installed UberMicro.

While it is ON, every time a pawn completes a prioritized task, you'll get a blue letter/notification, and the game will pause. You can click the letter to jump to the location, and probably give them their next instruction.

In this critical, defining moment, you are now the absolute king of micro, being able to tell every single pawn to do exactly what is needed, continously, repeatedly, without a single pawn wasting a single moment in between or wandering away because you forgot to give the next task.

You've saved everybody, and your colony lives and prospers.

Congratulations, king.

# Specific Additional Features

There is an additional button that controls whether you want a notification and pause when a drafted pawn finishes walking to their given destination.

# How to Install

At the top of this page, on the right-hand-side, a little ways down, will be a green button, labeled "Clone or download". Click it, then click "Download ZIP". Your browser will download it.

Unzip it, and it will spew out a single folder, which is probably named something like `UberMicro-master`.

Assuming you are working with default installation directories on a Windows system, you will want to move this entire folder into:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods`

If you did it correctly, the result should be a directory structure that looks something like this:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\UberMicro-master\Assemblies`

Then restart RimWorld and enable it like any other mod.

# How to Update

First and foremost, please note that I never test updating mods on older saved games. You can try it, but please assume that a new game might always be necessary.

I also don't explicitly test whether the mod can be disabled on an existing game. Please also assume that a new game might always be necessary.

With that out of the way:

Updating is just deleting the previous version of the mod and then installing a new version.

So again, assuming default installation directories on a Windows system, you'll want to delete the same folder that you added during installation, which probably looks something like:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\UberMicro-master`

Then follow the previous instructions to download and install the new version, by repeating the same steps as installing the original version.

# Bugs, New Features, and Updates

You are currently looking at a GitHub repository for managing application code. I work out of this GitHub repository, and so to talk about bugs, new features, or updates, you need to know a little bit about navigating a GitHub repository like this one.

Beneath the aforementioned green button "Clone or download", it will say "Latest commit", followed by a couple random characters, followed by an amount of time. This stamp indicates how long ago the mod was last updated.

So if you think you found a problem, check this stamp. Perhaps the mod has already been updated since you downloaded it last, and you should download a new version and update. See the above instructions for how to update.

By default, you are probably looking at the "master" branch. You can see this at the top of the page, on the left-hand-side, a little ways down, it will say "Branch: something", probably "Branch: master", with a little down arrow.

The "master" branch contains the current version of the mod which I consider to be tested and stable. Mostly. I guess.

Most (but not all) of my mods have a "beta" branch for pre-release, which might offer new features or bug fixes that should probably work, theoretically, but I haven't really done much testing on, so I'm not quite sure.

So if you tried updating from the "master" branch, and you still think you found a bug or a problem, or if you just want to try the shiny new features before everybody else, consider downloading the "beta" branch and installing that instead.

To do this, just click the button where it says "Branch: master", and then click the option for "beta". Congratulations! You've changed branches! Follow the same steps to download and install, except instead of `UberMicro-master` it will now be `UberMicro-beta`. You can have both versions installed, but please don't try to have both versions enabled at once using the in-game Mod menu.

You will probably see other choices besides "master" and "beta", but I don't recommend clicking them. I am probably in the middle of working on them, and they are probably only halfway done, and broken, otherwise they'd already be part of "beta".

So if you tried updating the master branch, and you tried the beta branch, and you still thing you found a bug, or a problem, or want to suggest a new feature, wander over to the "Issues" tab. You can find this at the very top of the page, you are currently on the first tab "Code", you want to change to the second tab "Issues".

You can look here to see if your bug, issue, or suggestion is already present, and add comments if you wish.

If it's not there, look to the right-hand-side, click the green button "New issue", just type a Title, and Leave a comment, and then look below and click the green button "Submit new issue". I will get back to you. Maybe. Eventually. Meanwhile, other users might be able to chime in and help you too!
