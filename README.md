# UberMicro

This is a mod for the game RimWorld by Ludeon Studios.

# Introduction and Explanation

You'll add the mod. You'll enable the mod. By default, it won't do anything.

It adds a MainTab, probably in the far right corner, labeled "UberMicro", with a button to turn the whole thing ON or OFF, and more buttons to turn specific features ON or OFF.

You'll leave the whole thing OFF most of the time. And it still won't do anything. And that's okay.

But when the shit really, really hits the fan, and your colony is in serious trouble, there will be a few critical game-hours where you need absolutely everybody to do exactly as you say, continously, without a single wasted moment.

And that is when you'll go into the MainTab and hit the button to turn it ON. This is why you installed UberMicro.

While it is ON, every time a pawn completes a prioritized task, you'll get a blue letter/notification, and the game will pause. You can click the letter to jump to the location.

In this critical, defining moment, you are now the absolute king of micro, being able to tell every single pawn to do exactly what is needed, continously, repeatedly, without a single pawn wasting a single moment in between or wandering away because you forgot to give the next task.

You've saved everybody, and your colony lives and prospers.

Congratulations.
