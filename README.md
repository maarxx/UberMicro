# Introduction and Explanation

You'll add the mod. You'll enable the mod. By default, it won't do anything. That's okay.

It might only work on new games, because it adds a Map Component, and because I really don't know.

Within the game, it adds a MainTab, probably in the far-bottom-right-corner, labeled "UberMicro", with a button to turn the whole thing ON or OFF, and more buttons to turn specific features ON or OFF.

You'll leave the whole thing OFF most of the time. And it still won't do anything. And that's still okay.

But when the shit really, really hits the fan, and your colony is in serious trouble, there will be a few critical game-hours where you need absolutely everybody to do exactly as you say, continously, without a single wasted moment, or else everybody is going to die today.

And when this time is upon you, this is when you'll go into the MainTab and hit the button to turn it ON. This is why you installed UberMicro.

While it is ON, every time a pawn completes a prioritized task, you'll get a blue letter/notification, and the game will pause. You can click the letter to jump to the location, and probably give them their next instruction.

In this critical, defining moment, you are now the absolute king of micro, being able to tell every single pawn to do exactly what is needed, continously, repeatedly, without a single pawn wasting a single moment in between or wandering away because you forgot to give the next task.

You've saved everybody, and your colony lives and prospers.

Congratulations, king.

# Specific Additional Features

There is an additional button that controls whether you want a notification and pause when a drafted pawn finishes walking to their given destination.
